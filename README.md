## Known Limitations & Potential Enhancements

*   **Client-Side Only:** Conversion happens in the browser. Very large images might hit browser memory limits or performance bottlenecks.
*   **GIF Animation:** Converting *from* animated GIFs currently only processes the first frame. Converting *to* animated GIF is not supported.
*   **Limited Output Formats:** Primarily supports core web formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP). Adding formats like BMP or TIFF might require additional canvas handling.
*   **No Quality Settings:** Currently uses default or preset quality settings (e.g., for JPEG). Adding sliders for quality/compression could be a future enhancement.
*   **Batch Conversion:** Only single-file conversion is supported currently.
*   **Image Preview:** No preview of the *converted* image before download.
